## About Me
I am Junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing a B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering with an emphasis in computational materials, and a B.S. in Data Science. I am interested in an R&D Internship for Summer 2021 or Co-Op for Spring/Summer 2020.

## My Experience
#### **Undergraduate Reseacher - *Mesoscale Computational Modeling Research Group*** 
- Conducted thousands of microstructure simulations with various base parameters on the Center for High Throughput Computing’s servers.
- Used Google Collab for a Convolutional Neural Network to find the optimal parameters to yield the highest conductivity within the composite material.
- Analyzed the results from the experiment and conducted a literature review in preparation for the publishing of our findings.

#### **Team Lead - *Engineers Without Borders***

- Member of EWB UW-Madison's Uganda Project. 
- Work to produce a detailed timeline and work to solve the logistics of completing the project with the club travel team and the in-country contractors/contacts. 
- The goal of this project is to bring clean and chlorinated water to the Lweza Primary School, addressing the community’s issue of lack of access to clean water.

#### **Member - *Data Science Club***
- Explore the Data Science field during club meetings and participate workshops run by major companies in the industry such as Nvidia.

#### **Member - *Material Advantage/American Foundry Society***
- Discuss topics in Materials Science during club meetings and participate in practical activities including learning how to forge.

## Practical Lab Experience
#### **Materials Laboratory I/II/III**
- Analysis of microstructures, Hardness Testing, X-Ray diffractometry, phase concentration determination

#### **Advanced General Chemisty**
- Titrations, electrochemical cells, kinetics calculations, half-life determination, synthesis of biodiesel

#### **Independent Research – Connecticut Science & Engineering Fair**
- Amplifying Heat Shock Protein Expression in Soybeans for Cross Protection in Substandard Growing Conditions
- Placed 5th place in Life Sciences, used: protein electrophoresis, FTIR, SEM microscopy, statistical analysis

#### **Analytical Chemistry**
- UV-Vis, Fourier-Transform Infrared, Atomic Absorption, and Mass spectroscopy; Gas and High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography; extraction of essential oils; synthesis of natural flavor compounds and acetylsalicylic acid

## Other Work Experience
#### **Housing Ambassador - *University Housing***
- Lead University Housing tours for prospective students, resolve any inquiries received through email or phones, and prepare office communications.
- Created a system for electronically logging all tour attendees to replace a paper version

#### **Intern - *Troy Fine Art Services***
- Assisted with home and corporate installations and office work such as creating spreadsheets and website design.

#### **Delivery Driver - *Nauti Dolphin***
- Delivered pizzas to the local area, as well as, completed general store tasks

#### **Counselor in Training & Lifeguard - *YMCA Camp Woodstock***
- Responsible for the general well-being of 12 campers. Attended a 4-week program on leadership skills. Monitored the waterfront to maintain safe conditions for all children in the water.
