## My Experience

#### **Undergraduate Researcher - *Mesoscale Computational Modeling Research Group*** 
- Conducted thousands of microstructure simulations with various base parameters on the Center for High Throughput Computing’s servers.
- Used Google Collab for a Convolutional Neural Network to find the optimal parameters to yield the highest conductivity within the composite material.
- Analyzed the results from the experiment and conducted a literature review in preparation for the publishing of our findings.

#### **Team Lead - *Engineers Without Borders***
- Member of EWB UW-Madison's Uganda Project. 
- Work to produce a detailed timeline and work to solve the logistics of completing the project with the club travel team and the in-country contractors/contacts. 
- The goal of this project is to bring clean and chlorinated water to the Lweza Primary School, addressing the community’s issue of lack of access to clean water.

#### **Member - *Data Science Club***
- Explore the Data Science field during club meetings and participate workshops run by major companies in the industry such as Nvidia.

#### **Member - *Material Advantage/American Foundry Society***
- Discuss topics in Materials Science during club meetings and participate in practical activities including learning how to forge.
